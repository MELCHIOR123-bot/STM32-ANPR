Retraining Plan for ANPR OCR Model - June 12, 2025

Objective:
- Improve OCR accuracy for Kenyan license plates by retraining the keras_ocr_float16_ctc.tflite model.

Current Issues:
- Model outputs inconsistent results (e.g., "MK2KMO" vs. "KAM119E", empty outputs).
- Likely trained on general OCR data, not optimized for Kenyan plate fonts/layouts.
- 200x31 resize may distort characters.

Action Plan:
1. Data Collection (Week 2, June 16-20, 2025):
   - Gather 500-1000 images of Kenyan license plates (yellow background, black text, e.g., "KAM119E").
   - Use existing 14 images from runs/detect/predict/images as a starting point.
   - Annotate images with ground truth text (e.g., label "KAM119E" for plate1.jpg).
2. Model Preparation (Week 2, June 16-20, 2025):
   - Use the original keras-ocr model (from https://github.com/faustomorales/keras-ocr) as a base.
   - Convert to TFLite format with float16 support for STM32H747I-DISCO compatibility.
3. Training (Week 3, June 23-27, 2025):
   - Fine-tune on collected dataset using CTC loss.
   - Adjust input size (e.g., 200x31 or native plate dimensions) based on data.
4. Testing and Integration (Week 3, June 23-27, 2025):
   - Test new model on all 14 images.
   - Integrate with YOLOv8 detection and deploy to STM32H747I-DISCO.

Resources:
- Dataset: Collect from local roads or online sources (e.g., maindikenya.net with permission).
- Tools: TensorFlow, keras-ocr, TFLite Converter.
- Hardware: Windows laptop for training, STM32 for inference.

Next Steps:
- Start data collection and annotation.
- Research keras-ocr setup for retraining.
